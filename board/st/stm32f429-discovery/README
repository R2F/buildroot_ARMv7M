I. Flashing U-Boot via ST-Link and OpenOCD (tested on version 0.8.0):
	1. Run OpenOCD (make sure it is in your PATH environment variable):
		$ openocd -f board/stm32f429discovery.cfg -c init -c"reset init" -c"poll"
	2. Connect to OpenOCD session via telnet:
		$ telnet localhost 4444
	3. In telnet interactive shell issue the following commands:
		> reset init
		> flash write_image erase <full_path_to_buildroot>/output/images/u-boot.bin 0x08000000
		> reset

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If openocd fails connecting to the target make sure you have proper udev rules for ST-LINK (check https://github.com/texane/stlink)
